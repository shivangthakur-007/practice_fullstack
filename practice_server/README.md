# Node.js
- Node is a open source, server-side javascript run time environment, that allows a developer to run javascript code on the server. Node.js is built on chrome v8 javascript engine and uses an event driven, non-blocking I/O, which makes it well - suited  for building scalalble and high -performance network applications. 
# v8 Engine 
- the v8 engine is an open-source javascript engine which is developed by chrome for their web browser. It is written in c++ language which is responsible for interpreting and executing javascript code in the browser.
- key features of v8 engine => JIT compilation, optimizations, Garbage collections, Multi-threaded execution, isolation.
- Node uses-> highly efficient and scalable web applications that can handle a large number of concurrent connections and I/O operations.


Node.js is a JavaScript runtime environment that executes JavaScript code outside of a browser. It is built on Chrome's V8 JavaScript engine and uses an event-driven, non-blocking I/O model that makes it lightweight and efficient. Node.js is often used to develop web servers and networking applications, but it can also be used for a wide variety of other tasks, such as data processing, machine learning, and graphical user interfaces.

Here are some of the key features of Node.js:

Cross-platform: Node.js runs on Windows, Linux, macOS, and other platforms.
Event-driven: Node.js uses an event-driven, non-blocking I/O model that makes it lightweight and efficient.
Asynchronous: Node.js can handle multiple requests concurrently without blocking.
Scalable: Node.js applications can be easily scaled up or down to handle increased or decreased traffic.
Easy to learn: Node.js is based on JavaScript, which is one of the most popular programming languages in the world.
Node.js is used by a wide variety of companies and organizations, including Netflix, PayPal, Uber, and NASA. It is also used to develop popular open source projects, such as Express.js, Koa.js, and Socket.IO.

Here are some examples of what Node.js can be used for:

Web servers
Networking applications
Data processing
Machine learning
Graphical user interfaces
Real-time applications
Chat applications
File servers
APIs
Microservices
Node.js is a powerful and versatile platform that can be used to develop a wide variety of applications. It is a popular choice for developers who are looking for a lightweight, efficient, and scalable runtime environment.

If you are interested in learning more about Node.js, there are many resources available online. There are also many tutorials and courses that can teach you how to develop Node.js applications.
